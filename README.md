# PNG Signature Extractor

PNG Signature Extractor is an AI-based tool that removes the white background from images containing signatures (blue or black ink) using a pre-trained UÂ²-Net model (via the rembg library). The extracted object is saved as a PNG with a transparent background.

**Important:**
- The input file must be a high-quality PNG screenshot of the signature on a white background.
- Place all input images in the Input folder and the output images will be saved in the Output folder.

## Features

- Processes all images in the Input folder.
- Extracts the object (e.g., a signature) by removing the white background.
- Saves output images as PNG files with transparent backgrounds.
- Appends "_extracted" to the original filename.
